## Why do we need this extension?

AI assistants like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and [Bard AI](https://bard.google.com/) are transforming how we interact with information, but the need to repeatedly type common prompts wastes time. Additionally, crafting prompts with specific context and formatting instructions can be tedious.

This chrome extension enables you to create libraries of reusable snippets containing custom questions, templates, and prompts. Instead of manually typing detailed queries multiple times, you can simply select the appropriate snippet and insert it into your chat with a single click.

## Examples

For instance, you can create an "Email" snippet with subject, recipient, body text, tone, and length parameters, allowing you to quickly generate AI-assisted email drafts. Similarly, a "Define" snippet can instantly provide word definitions and example sentences showcasing word usage.
